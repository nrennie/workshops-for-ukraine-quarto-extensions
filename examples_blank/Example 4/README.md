## Example 4

* Create an `_extensions` folder in the same directory as your `.qmd` file. (You may already have one from Exercise 3).

* Create another folder inside the `_extensions` folder with a name that will be the name of your extension e.g. `PrettyHTML`.

* Move your `styles.scss` file from Example 2 into the `PrettyHTML` folder.

* Create an `_extension.yml` file in the `PrettyHTML` folder.

* Write the YAML code specifying the:

  * extension title
  * author name
  * version number
  * contribution (HTML format with the `styles.scss` styling)
  
* Edit the YAML in the `.qmd` file to use this extension.
