## Exercise 1

* Create a Quarto document which outputs to HTML format.

* Include some text and a code block (in a programming language of your choice).

* Edit the YAML to use one of the Bootswatch themes. See [quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) for options.

* Further edit the YAML to change the `linkcolor`.

* Bonus: edit other YAML options to customise further.
